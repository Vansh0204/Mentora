# Favicon Setup

The `favicon.ico` file needs to be placed in this directory. You can:

1. Create a favicon using online tools like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
2. Save the generated favicon.ico file in this directory
3. The file should be named exactly `favicon.ico`

For best compatibility:
- Use a square image (recommended size: 32x32 pixels)
- Save in .ico format
- Make sure the icon is clear and recognizable at small sizes

Once you have your favicon.ico file, place it directly in this public directory.
